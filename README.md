1) Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to " predict the potentially fraudulent providers " based on the claims filed by them. Along with this, we will also discover important variables helpful in detecting the behaviour of potentially fraud providers. Further, we will study fraudulent patterns in the provider's claims to understand the future behaviour of providers.
